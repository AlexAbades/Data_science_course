# Seeing the distribution of a categorical column in reference to another categorical column or a numerical column

# BAR PLOT
# It's just a general plot that allows you to aggregate the categorical data based in some function, by default the mean
# You can think of these as visualization of a group by action.

# In the x argument we're going to pass a categorical column, and in the y argument we're going to pass a numerical
# column estimator parameter it's is a function, an aggregate function, a statistical function to estimate within
# each categorical bin.
